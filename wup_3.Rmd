```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
require(tidyverse)
require(tigerstats)
davisdata <- read.csv(file="UCDavis.csv")
```
## Our Goal is to answer this question Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row
## you choose to sit in??

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
ggplot(davisdata, aes(x = Seat, y = alcohol)) +
  geom_boxplot(notch = TRUE, outlier.colour = "red") +
  labs(title = "Notched Box Plot of Alcohol by Seat") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```



```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  
  
### get fancy  

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE,outlier.color = "red") + stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar') + labs(title="Fancy notch boxplot \n with 2 lines")
```

## Numerical Summarys 

```{r}
favstats(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
```
The people in the back are drinking alot more then people in the front and middle. The data shows that min all equal 0, but with the median,the people in the back have 4 and the people in the middle have 1 while the front have none. There is a big difference 

## Inferential Tests

```{r}
model1 <- aov(alcohol~Seat,data=davisdata)
summary.aov(model1)
```
```{r}
plot(TukeyHSD(model1))
```


```{r}
# Perform Tukey HSD test
tukey_result <- TukeyHSD(anova_result)

# Print the results
print(tukey_result)

```


There is a difference between the rows. 
## Conclusions
